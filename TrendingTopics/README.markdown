# Trending topics prototype
This is a prototype showing how to use PHP to mashup trending twitter topics and their explenations (from Whatthetrend.com) with semantic analysis (from opencalais.com) to generate a "screensaveresque" experience with pictures from Flickr. 

## Make it work
In order to get this prototype to work on your server, all you need to do is to generate API-keys for the different services:
* [Whatthetrend](http://api.whatthetrend.com/)
* [OpenCalais](http://www.opencalais.com/APIkey)
* [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
Then put these in MashUpServices.php at their appropriate place.
